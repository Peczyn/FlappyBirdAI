This project is game like flappy bird and an Generic AI.

Generic AI learns how to play the game by selecting the best bird of each generation

and then making similiar copies of it's "brain" to find the perfect solution.

You can see the that in this run bird from generation 61 was able to get as far as 25000 score whis is a lot.

Tested it for some time and tried to find optimal learning method.

I found out that the more birds each generation the faster they learned.

When using about 100 bird each generation it took only 7 generations to find the perfect AI.
